# The C Book

### Simply printing your "book content" pages to a Markdown file!

I recently learned about [LeanPub](https://leanpub.com/) which allows publishing books in **Markdown** syntax. 

I have always enjoyed Markdown and I believe Markdown should be the most efficient and productive styleguide for anybody writing stuff on computer programming languages and similar technical concepts. 

LeanPub reminded me of the paragraph I found on the [Original C Book website](http://publications.gbdirect.co.uk/c_book/) and gave me an idea:

> Although we ourselves do not have the time and tools to prepare this book in PDF format, we are very grateful to Professor Carlos Jos√© de Almeida Pereira of the University Estadual de Santa Cruz in Brazil for his work which he modestly describes as **'simply printing your "printer friendly" pages to a PDF file'**.

So this is just my opportunity for reproducing The C Book written by Mike Banahan, Declan Brady and Mark Doran using LeanPub and GitHub.

With my level of computer skills and literacy, I could not find a better way to be a part of the most peaceful ***Open source world***.

Hope this will be of use.
